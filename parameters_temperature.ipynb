       " I was walking through the park, enjoying the fresh air and the sunshine. I had been walking for a while, and I was starting to get thirsty. I looked around for a place to buy a drink, but there was nothing in sight. Just as I was about to give up, I saw something out of the corner of my eye. It was a small, white object, and it was floating in the air.\n",

It started out as a small, round ball, but then it stretched out into a long, thin line. Then, it started to twist and turn, and it eventually formed into the shape of a human being.\n",

       "I was so shocked that I couldn't move. I just stood there, staring at the figure in front of me. It was a woman, and she was beautiful. She had long, flowing hair, and her skin was as white as snow. She was wearing a long, white dress, and she had a kind smile on her face.\n",
